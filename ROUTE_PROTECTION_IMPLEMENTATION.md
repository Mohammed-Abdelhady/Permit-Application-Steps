# Route Protection Implementation Summary

## What was implemented:

1. **RouteGuard Component** (`src/components/shared/RouteGuard.tsx`)
   - Protects form steps based on data availability in Redux store
   - Shows toast notifications when users are redirected
   - Handles step-by-step validation logic

2. **Step Protection Logic**:
   - **Step 1 (Personal Information)**: Always accessible (no requirements)
   - **Step 2 (Family Financial)**: Requires Step 1 data to be completed
   - **Step 3 (Situation Description)**: Requires both Step 1 and Step 2 data

3. **Updated App.tsx**:
   - Wrapped Step 2 and Step 3 routes with RouteGuard components
   - Step 1 remains unprotected (entry point)

## How it works:

### Scenario 1: User tries to access Step 2 without Step 1 data

- User navigates to `/permit/family-financial`
- RouteGuard checks if `personalInformation` exists in Redux store
- If not found, redirects to `/permit/personal`
- Shows toast: "Please complete the Personal Information step first"

### Scenario 2: User tries to access Step 3 without Step 1 data

- User navigates to `/permit/situation`
- RouteGuard checks if `personalInformation` exists
- If not found, redirects to `/permit/personal`
- Shows toast: "Please complete the Personal Information step first"

### Scenario 3: User tries to access Step 3 with Step 1 data but no Step 2 data

- User navigates to `/permit/situation`
- RouteGuard finds `personalInformation` but not `familyFinancial`
- Redirects to `/permit/family-financial`
- Shows toast: "Please complete the Family Financial step first"

### Scenario 4: User has completed all required steps

- User can access any step normally
- No redirections occur

## Key Features:

- **Automatic Redirection**: Users are automatically sent to the appropriate step
- **User Feedback**: Toast notifications explain why the redirect happened
- **State Preservation**: Uses `replace` navigation to maintain clean browser history
- **Redux Integration**: Leverages existing Redux store for data validation
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces

## Files Modified:

1. `src/components/shared/RouteGuard.tsx` - New component
2. `src/components/index.ts` - Added export
3. `src/App.tsx` - Updated routes with RouteGuard protection

The implementation ensures users cannot skip steps and provides clear feedback when they try to access steps out of order.
